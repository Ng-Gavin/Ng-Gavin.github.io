  <h1 class="display-4">FIRST Robotics Competition</h1>
 <p>From 2018 to 2020 I was in my highschoolâ€™s robotics team. We were team 2441(Spartechs) from Maryknoll Highschool. We competed in the FIRST Robotics Competition(FRC). FRC is an international highschool robotics competition. Each year, teams are given a challenge to build a robot to complete a series of tasks. The challenge changes every year. The challenge is released in January, and teams have limited time to build a robot to compete. In 2018, the dealine was 6 weeks. In 2019 and 2020, the dealine was extended to a 3 months.</p>

<p>We were a small team of under 10 members. On this team, I was the lead of programming and electrical. I also dabbled in mechanical work and machining parts. Every member of the team was responsible of designing the robot together. I competed on the team for 3 seasons. Every year, we competed at the FRC Hawaii Regional. In 2019, we got 2nd place and received a wild card slot. This allowed us to compete in 2019 championships.</p>

<p>As the lead of programming and electrical, I was responsible for coding the robot, wiring the electrical componenents, and running tubing for pneumatics. I also took up tasks in machining parts for the robots frame and mechanisms, as well as, assembly of the robot. I was also responsible for teaching new members how to program and wire the robot.</p>

<p>I currently do not have a picture of the robot from 2018. This robot was designed as a moving ramp with a claw mechanism to move around a milk crate. The robot was programmed in C++. The robot code can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Ng-Gavin/Team2441_2018_FRC">Team2441_2018_FRC</a></p>

<p>This my teams 2019 robot. This robot was designed to pick up and deposit velcro-lined polycarbonate disks, and to launch balls. This robot was programmed in Java. The robot code can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Ng-Gavin/2019-FRC-Robot">Team2441_2019_FRC</a></p>
