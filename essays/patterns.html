<h2 id="design-patterns-the-blueprints-of-code">Design Patterns, the Blueprints of Code</h2>

<p>Design patterns in coding are like the blueprints and techniques used in construction. Like an architect would design and build a structure, a developer also employs design patterns when constructing software applications. These patterns serve as standardized templates, offering tried-and-tested solutions to recurring problems in software design, akin to the construction industry’s architectural designs and building methodologies.</p>

<h2 id="typical-patterns">Typical Patterns</h2>

<p>The “prototype” pattern functions much like creating a template or a mold in construction. Just as an architect would create a sketch before actual construction begins, this pattern allows me to clone objects I’ve “sketched”, saving time and resources in developing new components within my web apps.</p>

<p>The “observer” and “publish-subscribe” patterns are comparable to the interconnected systems within a building. In coding, this pattern enables one object to observe and respond to changes or events in another object. This is like how various systems in a building (like heating, ventilation, and lighting) wait for controls to be switched and before they get updated to perform a task.</p>

<p>The “reactive data” pattern is comparable to adaptive systems in construction, where materials or systems adjust to external stimuli. In coding, this pattern allows the application to react to changes automatically, updating the interface or data without explicit instructions.</p>

<p>The “singleton” pattern allows only one instance of a particular class throughout the application, just as there might be a single entrance to a building, ensuring centralized control and access.</p>

<p>The “front controller” pattern acts as the lobby or reception desk of a building, handling incoming requests and directing them to the appropriate parts of the application.</p>

<p>The “MVC” (Model-View-Controller) pattern is akin to segregating the architectural design into distinct sections and the receptionist directing people: the model represents the data, the view represents the presentation layer, and the controller serves as the intermediary directing actions between the two.</p>

<p>The “factory” pattern resembles an assembly line in construction, streamlining the creation of objects without specifying their exact types. It’s like a construction factory producing standardized building components without detailed knowledge of the final structure they’ll be part of.</p>
