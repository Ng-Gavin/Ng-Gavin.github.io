## Overview

The problem: Students have many opinions about where their classes are held. They may want to know what other students think about the classrooms they are in. Professors also might have their usual classroom and stick with it, but might want to switch it up after many semesters.

The Solution: Create a database where students and professors can review and rate different classrooms.
