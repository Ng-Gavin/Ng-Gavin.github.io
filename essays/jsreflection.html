<h2 id="javascriptmy-newest-language">JavaScript:My newest language</h2>

<p>JavaScript is a good language that provides a more flexible experience compared to Java. Much of the syntax is similar, but JavaScript provides many shortcuts and simplifications to quite common coding implementations. One of the big standouts was the ease with which you can setup, access, and update data in classes. Another benefit was being able to traverse a string as if it was an array of characters. While programming in JavaScript, it felt like a mix of Java syntax and simplicity of Python. Much like Python, it feels a bit strange having variables that donâ€™t need to be initiated with a certain data type. This gives versatility when used correctly but can equally cause a lot of errors when not properly implemented. Overall, JavaScript is a great language that is easy to learn and provides many powerful tools once you learn to use them.</p>

<h2 id="wod-practice-makes-perfect">WOD: Practice makes perfect</h2>

<p>WODs have been a great way to develop skills in JavaScript. Being challenged with problems that combine multiple techniques creates a different learning environment from reading about syntax and how they work. The time constraint given to complete them is also beneficial in that it pushes the need to have good conceptual knowledge and skill to approach a problem effectively. This way even if references are occasionally needed to achieve proper syntax, it is known what needs to be looked up to. Compared to the less effective solution of looking through a whole index of functions and syntax, this saves a considerable amount of time.</p>
