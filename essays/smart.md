When developing software, there are many points where one can get stuck without a clear way to proceed. The internet is a powerful tool containing more information than you can imagine. It’s the greatest way to find answers to most questions you can think of. However there are cases when you have a question so specialized and specific that the information you want doesn't exist or is too well hidden. Being unable to solve a problem alone isn’t uncommon, but you should always give it your best shot. When you’ve truly reached a dead end, having public forums where people can come together and solve a problem is invaluable. However when you don’t reach out in a thoughtful manner, it’s very likely that no one will extend a hand to help.

Before publicly posting a question, you should exhaust all other options first. Most people don’t have the time of day to be your personal assistant, they are doing you a favor by answering your question. Therefore, you should try your best to meet them more than half way. By posing a detailed question with what you’ve tried or found already, you lessen the amount of work needed to help you. Your programming savior shouldn’t need to play 20 questions with you to get to the starting point. People are more willing to help if you make it easier for them to do so.

Public forums, like StackOverflow, always have multitudes of new questions every minute. With so many questions and so little time, questions with good formatting will get answers quicker. In a question titled “How do i add slash commands for play music kick ban warn?”, there are many problems. The biggest problem with this question is the confusing title. This badly worded title alone makes someone unlikely to even check out what this person has to say. Going into the details of this question raises even more red flags. Having bad grammar, punctuation, and barely coherent sentences adds to the difficulty of understanding what’s being asked. Furthermore, no relevant links or information about what is trying to be accomplished coupled with a strange variety of tags shrouds the end goal in mystery. For a question that seems to be about python code, no python code is supplied to be inspected. If you have to question what a question is asking, then there’s a problem with it.

Good questions are clear and concise, providing all necessary information without fluff. One such question is “How to iterate over rows in a DataFrame in Pandas”. This question is very short but provides all the needed information. A sample of data is supplied with a bit of code to further illustrate what the end goal is. The user even supplied a link to a similar question and asked for more information regarding it.

It’s vital to learn about proper etiquette for posting questions to forums. As a programmer that likes to try new things and learn, I know I’ll inevitably hit a wall that I will need help getting over. Getting info from this powerful resource is different from any other resource. This resource involves interaction with other human beings, thus it is important to develop the habits needed to act appropriately.
